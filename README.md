# ðŸ‘‹Hi there 
### I'm Omar Faruk, Becoming a good minded developer requires the right intention, hard work and practice. So for almost a long year I was able to identify myself as a Full-Stack web developer by adopting that consistency. I have learned a lot in my journey as a developer and I'm still learning and will learn in the future.
